    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 piece ginger (grated)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (crushed)</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp. turmeric</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp. cumin</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp. curry powder</li>
        <li>300g red lentils (washed)</li>
        <li>1 tin chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1.2 l vegetable stock</li>
        <li>Coriander to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, add the coconut oil to a large saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, add the onion, ginger and garlic, and fry for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the stock in a bowl - by melting a stock pot in 1200 ml of boiling water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Then add the turmeric, cumin and curry powder to the pan and fry for a further minute, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the lentils and stir to ensure they mix well with the ingredients already in the pan. Then add the tomatoes and stir.</li>
        <li>Now carefully pour in the stock, stirring slowly to make sure everything is evenly distributed. Lower the heat, place the lid on the pan and leave to simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once your lentil soup has cooked, stir well and then divide with rice into meal containers to take away. Garnish with coriander.</li>
